 #Cells use one of two methods to break down glucose and produce ATP, efficient aerobic pathway that requires oxygen or using glycolysis, an inefficient anaerobic pathway.
 #Glycolysis is the metabolic process of breaking down carbohydrates, such as glucose, and making enzymes & ATP. Glycolysis is part of the anaerobic pathway and is used when oxygen levels are too low and cannot support the level of ATP being produced
 #The model assumes that cells have a target level of ATP demand. The model is testing what happens to cells under anaerobic conditions (glycolysis), during ten geenrations, depending on the ATP levels produced.

#Cells uses glucose to produce ATP, but glycolysis is an insuffiecient way of producing ATP (2 ATP per glucose molecule broken down)
#Glucose consumption is driven by the need to meet ATP demand.

# for a healthy cell a value of 1  glucose intake yields a healthy amount of ATp production and no hydrogen production allowing the  cell to simply reproduce
